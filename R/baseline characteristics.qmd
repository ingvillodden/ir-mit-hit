#### Baseline characteristics starting the intervention

```{r}

# In this code chunk each of the 44 individual participant´s first test in the 
# in the intervention is found (based on the code list), and then mean baseline 
# characteristics of the participants are calculated

# Participants who´s first test was the pre test in CON
# 
baseline_con <- pre_post_data %>%
  filter(period == "con", timepoint == "pre", !id %in% c("18", "20", "40")) %>%
  print()

# Participants who´s first test was the pre test in MIT
baseline_mit <- pre_post_data %>% 
  filter(period == "con", timepoint == "pre", 
         !id %in% c("3", "8", "15", "16", "21", "36", "42")) %>%
  print()


# Calculating baseline characteristics
baseline <- baseline_con %>%
  inner_join(baseline_mit) %>%
  summarise(across(c(age, bodymass, bodyheight, vo2.rel.max), 
                   list(m = mean, s = sd), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  print()

```

#### Training history

```{r}

# In this code chunk the participants average training history before the 
# intervention is calculated


training_history <-read_excel("data/training_history_ir_data.xlsx", na = "na") %>% 
       summarise(active.years.m = mean(active.years, na.rm = TRUE),
                  active.years.s = sd(active.years, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% print()


```

#### Temperature at all prolonged cycling tests

```{r}

# In this code chunk the ambient temperature at all prolonged cycling tests
# is calculated

temp.tests <-
  cycling_data %>%
  select(id, temperature.start) %>% 
  summarise(temp.m = mean(temperature.start, na.rm = TRUE),
            temp.s = sd(temperature.start, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  print()

```
