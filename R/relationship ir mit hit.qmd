# In this code chunk simple linear models are made to investigate whether there
# is a relationship between the observed individual responses/outcomes/changes
# for the 22 participants in the MIT block and the HIT block for all 
# investigated outcome variables. More over, ICC scores are computed to 
# investigate the reliability of the changes in outcome variables between blocks


# Performance index
