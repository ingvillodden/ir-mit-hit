While it is well established that responses to standardized endurance exercise training varies between individuals, the underlying factors driving this response variability are not fully understood. 

The present study aimed to investigate training response heterogeneity among well-trained cyclists undergoing a one-week high-intensity interval training (HIT) block, a moderate-intensity interval training (MIT) block, and a time-matched control period with regular training.

Objectives were to 
1) investigate the magnitude of between-individual response variability to MIT and HIT blocks
2) investigate whether within-individual responses to MIT and HIT blocks were consistent
3) investigate whether within-individual responses to the different training blocks were associated with individual physiological characteristics
